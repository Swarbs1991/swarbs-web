						<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is Joe and I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for creating bold, striking graphics
						and fun user interfaces that I try to combine to give a completely unique user experience.
						<br><br>
						This website will be an ongoing project for me to have some fun with, as well as showcase a bit of
						my work from past jobs as well as things I've enjoyed producing in my down-time.
						<br><br>
						I love working in Notepad++ to code simple sites like this one from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and some simple Javascript (mainly JQuery).
						<br><br>However, much of my time over the past few years has been spent working with content management systems.
						WordPress is where I feel most at home though, writing custom queries in PHP and using tools like Visual Studio to compile Sass to SCSS
						and then test it all locally using Xampp to create virtual Linux servers.
						<br><br>
						I also have experience with Joomla, but most recently Shopify where in my current job (as well as other more design based responsibilites)
						I look after the website as well as do a little development here and there to make additions to the existing UI of the stock theme.
						<br><br>
						Anyway, there are a million combinations of languages and technologies which can be used, but the key is to achieve the desired result, 
						cleanly and efficiently with whatever tools are appropriate.
						<br><br>
						Thanks for dropping by, Please enjoy this site and comment if you like. I shall be adding more content as time goes on.

						<h2>A Bit About This Site</h2>
						<p>The plan was to make something eye-catching and inherently intuitive to navigate, but also really simple.
						<br><br>
						I made this website using Notepad++ and testing locally before I had enough content to put online, although I intend this
						to be an ongoing project, something I update regularly and can also use as a platform to to test out new ideas.
						<br><br>
						I made use of CSS3 transactions and some JQuery functions to make the navigation more interactive and also adapted some Javascript
						to use in the background to add to the visuals, as I didn't want the site to feel static.
						<br><br>
						<br> The Javascript makes use of HTML5 Canvas and a basically just changed the variables to suit what I wanted.
						<br>
						The original example of this from Dudley Storey can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/NbNjjX" title="Original Code on CodePen" target="blank">here on <span class="pen">CodePen</span></a>

							<div class="LS col collapsible">								<img src="images/LS-web-logo_transparent-bg.png" alt="Little Secrets Clothing Web Logo">
								<h2>littlesecretsclothing.co.uk</h2>
								<p>The Little Secrets website is hosted on the Shopify ecommerce platform.
								<br><br>
								Recently last year I implemented a new theme to bring the storefront more up to date and also run more efficiently by making use of features like Lazy Loading, 
								but also to keep the site as up to date as possible with the latest web standards and Shopify's API.
								<br><br>
								My main responsibilities for this site continue to be to improve usability and site speed in a number of ways. 
								Some of that has been done just by editing product descriptions and adding alt text to be more SEO friendly,
								as well as optimising images for the web and also cutting down reliance on apps as much as possible by finding other simple solutions.

								<p>Toolally Jewellery is the successful jewellery brand and sister company to the fabl.
								<br><br>
								This was my first brush with an e-commerce platform. The website was built in WordPress and uses WooCommerce to power it's storefront.
								<br><br>
								This website was always getting new content and I was tasked with everything from adding new media content produced by the design team, 
								improving the overall UI and UX by making changes to the function and styling of the navigation and implementing filters on the collection pages, 
								to migrating the website to a Virtual Private Server along with a host of other changes to improve site speed and performance.

							<div class="fabl col collapsible">

								<h2>thefabl.com</h2>
								<p>The fabl was the website of one of my previous employers, a 'full content' marketing agency based in Broughton, Skipton in North Yorkshire.
								<br><br>
								The site was mainly used to showcase work from clients' projects as well as give prospective clients an introduction to the team.
								<br><br>
								However, the hompeage of the website was more focused on highlighting the company's USP: their ability to tell a story, enabling them to construct a complete marketing package for clients,
								with glossy print products crammed with striking graphics and photos, along with social media, blogging and also responsive, intuitive websites.
								<br><br>
								thefabl.com was built by a company called Gooey. As it was already a well established site, I inherited responsisbilities
								like posting articles on the blog and adding case studies written by our copywrighters, along with adding any new members of staff on the 'Who We Are' page.
								<br><br>
								My favourite part of working on this site was when I was tasked with implementing design changes on the homepage.
								<br>
								Here I worked closely with the design team to add in their graphics into each section (after some web optimisation),
								piece by piece I added in separate graphics and animated them to match the intended effect as instructed by the head designer.
								<br><br>
								This was the first time (commercially) where I had the opportunity to animate images and elements, combining CSS3 and JQuery 
								as well as reusing any of Gooey's code to ensure nothing left was redundant.
								<br><br>
								I really enjoyed it.

								<h2>The Bay Horse Inn, Roughlee</h2>
								<p>As part owner of the family business, when we got the tenancy for the Bay Horse I quickly set my skill with design and web development 
								to the task of starting to build a brand and online presence.
								<br><br>
								I had complete oversight of any designs, from logo and brand development, to print media and the practical aspects of setting up the website and social media.
								<br><br>
								The pub had been shut for years after the last tenant suffered a serious fire, so as well as promote our food and drink, it was imperative to publish that the pub was actually open again as widely as possible.
								<br><br>
								The website was initally built like this one - a really simple site, written eniterly in Notepadd++.
								<br>I later redid the site during the first lockdown in 2020 and opted for WordPress.
								<br><br>
								The theme I used was a barebones theme that I developed using PHP, Sass and some Javascript and tested offline using Xampp.
								<br>
								The main function of the site didn't change at all. We still used it to advertise our presence as well as show off photos of food, drink and events, 
								but installing WordPress meant we had a much easier platform to delligate adding media and editing copy among the rest of the family.
								<br><br>
								As we have now left the Bay Horse, we have reverted the site just back to just one page - a goodbye, thanking our staff and customers
								and wishing the new tenants well, but you can see an earlier (offline) version hidden away here: COMING SOON
